# Cookiecutter Python Project Template

Yet another cookiecutter template for a Python project.

This is @evamaxfield's personal cookiecutter template for quickly spinning up new Python projects. For scripts, larger research projects, or production packages. Very opinionated.

## Quickstart

1. `pip install cookiecutter`
2. `cookiecutter gh:evamaxfield/cookiecutter-py-package`
3. `cd {{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}`
4. `git init`
5. `just install`
